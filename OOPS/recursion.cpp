//Recursion
/* Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.*/


/* Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int sum(int k){
    if(k>0){
        return k + sum(k-1);
    }
    else{
        return 0;
    }
}

int main(){
    int result = sum(10);
    cout << result;
    return 0;
}

/*The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.*/
